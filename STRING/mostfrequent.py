'''5.Write the function mostFrequentLetters(s), that takes a string s, and ignoring case (so "A" and "a" are treated the same), 
returns a lowercase string containing the letters of s in most frequently used order. (In the event of a tie between two letters, follow alphabetic order.)
Eg - "We Attack at Dawn" is input. Output should be atwcdekn'''
